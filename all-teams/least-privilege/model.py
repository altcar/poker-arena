"""
The bot: preflop charts by depth, then equity against an estimated range for
pot-odds calls and value bets, with a few bluffs when the fold rate pays for
them. Between hands it learns each opponent's habits by team name: see
_score_hand and the counters kept in Model.

The charts and thresholds are starting values, tuned against heads-up play at
25 big blinds. With more players the same charts are tightened.
